  ⚠️ This update changes the port that Tallycoin Connect runs on, from 8123 to 8124. This is to avoid a conflict
  with the Home Assistant app, which now runs on port 8123.


  If you are curently running both Tallycoin Connect and Home Assistant, please update Tallycoin Connect
  first, and then update Home Assistant.


  There are no updates to the Tallycoin Connect app itself.
