description: >-
  Seafile is an open source cloud storage system with file encryption and group sharing.


  Collections of files are called libraries, and each library can be synced separately.
  A library can be encrypted with a user chosen password. This password is not stored on the server,
  so even the server admin cannot view a file's contents.
