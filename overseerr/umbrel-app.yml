  Overseerr is a request management and media discovery tool built to work with your existing Plex ecosystem.

  During initial set-up, you will need to input your Umbrel device's IP address to connect to Plex (and optional services such as Radarr and Sonarr).
  You can find your device's IP address by visiting your router's admin dashboard or by using an IP scanning tool like Angry IP Scanner.
