  Think of Vikunja like the notebook you have with all your things to keep track of. But with superpowers.


  STAY ORGANIZED

  Organize all of your tasks in projects. Create subprojects organize everything hierarchical and keep related stuff grouped together.


  COLLABORATE WITH PEERS

  Vikunja lets you easily share a project with another user or a whole team! Assignments show who's working on what.


  USE IT HOW YOU NEED IT

  You can view your tasks in the classic list view - or in a Gantt Chart, or Table view, or Kanban Board. Whatever you need!
