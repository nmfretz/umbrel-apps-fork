  AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you set it up, it’ll cover ALL your home devices,
  and you don’t need any client-side software for that. With the rise of Internet-Of-Things and connected devices, it becomes
  more and more important to be able to control your whole network.
